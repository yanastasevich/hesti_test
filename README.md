# hesti_test
Welcome to the automation project!

The project is developed with Cypress and has the Page Object Model structure with dedicated pages for Map, Polygon and Marker.

Under e2e test scenarios are placed. happyPathScenario.cy.js and edgeCaseScenario.cy.js are implemented fully, the rest are described as stubs - with an outline of test steps to be implemented. However, already coded functionality gives a solid basis for writing the rest of the scenarios.

There also test data files such as polygonTestData, cypress.env.json
